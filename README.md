## Specification-Driven Development

This template includes complete spec-kit integration:

### Example Specs

- **Authentication** (`specs/001-example/`) — Complete working example
- **Notifications** (`specs/002-notifications/`) — Real-world example
- **User Profile** (`specs/003-user-profile/`) — Multi-feature example

### Getting Started with Specs

1. Copy `specs/001-example/` structure for new features
2. Follow the [Spec Integration Guide](docs/spec-integration/readme.md)
3. Write tickets from specs using [Tickets Guide](docs/spec-integration/tickets.md)
4. Create knowledge base entries with [KB Guide](docs/spec-integration/knowledge-base.md)

## Repository Analyzer

Check if any GitHub repository meets best practices standards:

### Quick Start

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/analyze-repo

# Analyze any repository
./scripts/analyze-repo owner/repo

# Examples
./scripts/analyze-repo facebook/react
./scripts/analyze-repo kubernetes/kubernetes
./scripts/analyze-repo google/go-cloud
```

### Output

```
🟡 Overall Compliance Score: 72/100

Category Breakdown:
documentation       [████████████████░░] 90/100
governance          [██████████░░░░░░░░] 60/100
lifecycle           [████████░░░░░░░░░░] 40/100
...

Recommendations for Improvement:
🔴 HIGH PRIORITY:
1. Governance: Missing governance documentation
```

### Features

- ✅ Compliance scoring (0-100%)
- ✅ Category breakdown with weights
- ✅ Quality checks for key files
- ✅ Specific, actionable recommendations
- ✅ JSON output for automation
- ✅ Node.js or Python (no dependencies)

See [docs/tools/QUICK-START.md](docs/tools/QUICK-START.md) for full guide.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Use as Template

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/RockRunner007/template.git

# Or use as template on GitHub: "Use this template" button
```

### 2. Customize for Your Project

- Edit `prompts/project-context.md` with your project details
- Customize docs in `docs/lifecycle/`, `docs/governance/`, etc. to match your team
- Update workflows in `.github/workflows/` for your tech stack
- Add your code to `src/` and tests to `tst/`

### 3. Start Using Specifications

- Create your first specification in `specs/` using the template in `specs/001-example/`
- Use [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) format for consistent feature documentation
- Link specs to GitHub issues and PRs for traceability

### 4. Enable CI/CD

Workflows are manual by default. To enable automated CI, edit `.github/workflows/*.yml`:

```yaml
# Change from:
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

# To:
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
```

### 5. Set Up Team Processes

Review and customize:
- [Code Review Standards](docs/governance/code-review-standards.md)
- [Change Management](docs/governance/change-management.md)
- [Team Onboarding](docs/governance/onboarding.md)
- [Testing Strategy](docs/testing/test-pyramid.md)

## Quick reference links

- [Spec-Driven Development](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) — Build high-quality software faster using specifications and AI agents
- [GitHub best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features) — Repository configuration guidance
- [Security best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security) — GitHub security features and guidance

Workflows in `.github/workflows/` are manual by default (`workflow_dispatch`). To enable automated triggers:

1. Edit the workflow file
2. Replace the `on: { workflow_dispatch: }` block with desired triggers:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly
```

## Security

- **Reporting** — Publish [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to define vulnerability reporting process
- **Automated Scanning** — Include CodeQL, secret scanning, dependency scanning, container scanning
- **Infrastructure Security** — Use tfsec and similar tools for IaC validation
- **Secrets Management** — Store in GitHub Secrets, never commit credentials
- **Access Control** — Use CODEOWNERS for permission management
- **Policy Enforcement** — Branch protection rules, required reviews, status checks

See [docs/testing/security-testing.md](docs/testing/security-testing.md) for comprehensive security testing guide.
