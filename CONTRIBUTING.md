# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributions to this template. A few guidelines to keep contributions consistent and reviewable:

## Guidelines

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`
- Write clear, focused commits and a descriptive PR title
- Include a short description of your change and rationale in the PR body
- Keep changes small and reviewable. If the change is large, open an issue first to discuss design
- Run linters and tests locally before opening a PR
- If you add or change workflows, prefer `workflow_dispatch` in the template and explain how to enable automation in your PR
- Ensure documentation (README, runbooks, prompts) is updated with any behavioral changes

## Review Process

Maintainers will review PRs and may request changes or tests. Contributors can expect respectful, constructive feedback.
